0. Globals

# .env (optional, if you want to reuse)
BRAND_URL=https://ezprofitsoftware.com/lazy-marketers-dream-come-true/
BRAND_NAME="Leadstorm"


1. Universal Nav-Bar Signature
Add to every page/layout template (*.ejs, index.html, etc.) right-aligned:


html
CopyEdit
<a href="https://https://ezprofitsoftware.com/lazy-marketers-dream-come-true/"
   target="_blank"
   class="text-sm font-semibold text-blue-500 hover:underline whitespace-nowrap">
  🚀 by <span class="font-bold">Leadstorm</span>
</a>

Keep the class list exactly as above so palette swaps won’t remove the branding color.



2. “About” Modal
Insert ℹ️ icon next to the signature. On click, load /partials/about.ejs modal:


html
CopyEdit
<h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Leadstorm AI {{APP_NAME}}</h2>
<p>© 2025 Brighter Side Enterprises LLC</p>
<p>Built for the Leadstorm marketing suite.</p>
<p><a class="text-blue-500 underline" href="https://YourSqueezePage.com" target="_blank">
   Get updates, bonuses &amp; tutorials
</a></p>

{APP_NAME} = Email Verifier / Lead IQ / Tracker Assistant (pass via render locals).



3. CSV Export Footer
In every endpoint that streams a CSV (/download in Verifier and IQ, /export in Tracker):


Prepend one comment row before the header row:


js
CopyEdit
// node/express example
res.write(`# Exported from Leadstorm AI – https://https://ezprofitsoftware.com/lazy-marketers-dream-come-true/\r\n`);

Excel ignores hash comments; plain-text viewers will see the link.



4. Console Easter-Egg
At the top of each main client JS (public/js/*.js), add:


js
CopyEdit
console.log(
  "%cBuilt with ❤️ by Lee Cole & Gloria Gunn  – https://ezprofitsoftware.com/lazy-marketers-dream-come-true/",
  "color:#1d4ed8;font-weight:bold;font-size:14px"
);


5. Non-Blocking Ping (Optional)
On server start (index.js of each app):


js
CopyEdit
fetch("https://YourDomain.com/ping?app=" + APP_SLUG + "&v=1.0").catch(()=>{});

GET only, no PII. App must not fail if the request errors.
